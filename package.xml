  <description>
    miniroscpp contains C++ code for doing things that are not necessarily ROS
    related, but are useful for multiple packages. This includes things like
    the ROS_DEPRECATED and ROS_FORCE_INLINE macros, as well as code for getting
    backtraces.

    All references to boost were replaced by standard libraries.
